# Email Management AppScript
Inspired by a YouTube video and my dwindling Google Storage, I used the following repository to create an App Script to purge old emails. I added a logging function (logOldEmails) to verify that it was searching for the correct emails. I also utilized ChatGPT to review the code before running it. Additionally, I backed up my emails using Google Takeout (see the link below for original instructions).
