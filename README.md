# Email Management AppScript
Inspired by a YouTube video and the dwindling google storage I used the following repo to create an AppScript to Purge old emails. I added a logging function (logOldEmails) to check if it was searching for the right emails. I used ChatGPT to check the code before I ran it. I also Backed up my emails using Google Takeout (see link below for full instructions).
